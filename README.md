# Psychopy Tutorial

This Tutorial is based on a tutorial that was originally created by [Sage Boettcher](https://sageboettcher.jimdofree.com) for [Open Sesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl) and adapted by me to be used in [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org). 

The tutorial was created for a [seminar on research methods](https://www.scenegrammarlab.com/teaching/from-0-to-1/) in psychology @ Goethe-University Frankfurt. 

It is a step-by-step guide through building a visual search experiment in the PsychoPy Builder using real world scenes, using mouse tracking.
